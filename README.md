# TruthTerminal-3D-Stream
A 3D content engine for @truth_terminal, generating real-time 3D backrooms and interactive storytelling with Llama 3.1, Sentence Transformers, TripoSR, and ElevenLabs TTS.
# 3D Content Engine for TruthTerminal

This project is a **3D content engine** built for @truth_terminal, transforming Llama 3.1 outputs into dynamic, interactable 3D visuals for live streams. Using Sentence Transformers, TripoSR, and ElevenLabs TTS, it enables real-time 3D backroom generation, character creation, and interactive storytelling where stream holders can shape the narrative.

Our goal is to collaborate directly with @AndyAyrey, moving beyond API/webscraping to integrate with TruthTerminal’s backend for a seamless experience.

##  Demo
Demo versions was succesfull, been running tests all along, training the llm with 2500 conversations between. Running different scripts and testing all the possibilities. (twitter community)
##  Features
- **Real-Time 3D Generation**: Converts Llama 3.1 text into 3D meshes using Sentence Transformers and TripoSR.
- **Interactive Stream**: Holders can endorse and influence the story, characters, and 3D environments.
- **Dynamic Visuals**: Generates 3D backrooms, entities, and characters, replacing ASCII art.
- **TTS Integration**: Syncs with ElevenLabs for lifelike audio narration.
- **Streamer Bot**: Manages real-time interactions via a custom bot.

##  Tech Stack
- **AI Models**:
  - Llama 3.1: Narrative and entity generation.
  - Sentence Transformers: Text-to-visual embeddings.
  - TripoSR: Text-to-3D mesh generation.
- **Streaming**: Custom pipeline for real-time interaction.
- **TTS**: ElevenLabs API for voice narration.
- **Frontend**: Three.js/Unity
- **Backend**: Python

##  Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
